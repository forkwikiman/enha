한국의 남성 아이돌 그룹 [동방신기](%EB%8F%99%EB%B0%A9%EC%8B%A0%EA%B8%B0.md)의 5번째 일본 정규 앨범
[TONE](TONE%28%EC%95%A8%EB%B2%94%29.md)의 3번 트랙. "스카파"의 CM송으로 타이업되기도 했다.
전반적인 반응은 "맨 처음 들었을 때는 그냥 그런데, 들으면 들을수록 중독된다.". 짙게 깔리는 헤비한 기계음 사운드에, 중반부터 시작되는
"I Think U Know" 가사가 반복되는 구간이 중독성이 있다. 팬들 사이에서 많은 지지를 받는 곡은 아니나, 이 곡을 앨범 내 최고의
곡으로 꼽는 이들도 있긴 하다. 이들의 말에 의하면 "I Think U Know"하는 부분이 계속 머릿속에서 맴돈다고...
