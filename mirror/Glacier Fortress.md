## 6 공략 ¶

Be sure to bring ample wound and fear pots for this instance.  

  

Tier 1  
Snowbear-wight Matron aggros if any of her cubs are attacked. After killed,
her ghost will spawn but wont aggro unless in proxmity. If not aggroed, the
ghost will despawn shortly.  
Snowbear-wight Cub are blind and will aggro if the group is close for too
long. If killed in view of a Matron, the Matron will gain a +200% damage buff
for each cub killed.  
Fanatic does AOE damage to anyone close and also randomly knock backs.

  
  
  

Coldbear  
Stage 1 - Tank and spank. If you see a red shield, it reflects 90% of damage
dealt, so stop attacking when it's up. Coldbear will occasionally apply an
incurable blue Ice Shards DoT that does around 1k damage each tick and damage
to all fellowship members within 10m when it expires. It's best to run to a
safe spot away from others until then.

  

Stage 2 - After Coldbear is defeated, his spirit is released and the battle
continues. Frozen wights around the room will activate if walked next to, so
try to avoid them. Coldbear's spirit will stun, slow, and knockback as well as
continue to throw out blue DoT's, sometimes all at the same time.  

  

"I need more power, X." Run away if he calls your name.  
"Let the frost embrace you." Ice shards DoT. Run to an area away from other
members until it expires. Healer needs to keep heals on this person while it
does its damage.  
"No more wriggling, X!"  
"Stand still!"  
"Your scurrying around must stop!"

  
  
  

Osan  
Have the main tank kite the adds around the room while the off tank stays on
Osan. Each wave of adds killed increases Osan's tier and he does more damage.
Everyone else should burn Osan, just watch out for his AOE attack that puts a
large irremovable bleed on anyone that get's hit by it. Also, if someone get's
a blue eye that person will lose 100% morale if the timer expires and is still
in combat. To get rid of it remove the corruption from Osan before the timer
expires.

  
  
  
  

Drugoth  
Stage 1: Drugoth begins with knock back skills so it's best to stand on the
inside of him so that if he knocks you, you won't go flying off the edge. You
can avoid the knock back by moving away from him when he gives his cue. There
is also a constant whirlwind that moves around and will silence anyone for 10s
who get's close. It can be potted if needed but it's best to avoid it if your
skills are affected by it.

  

"You are not worthy to be near me." or "Get away from me!" Knock back, move
away.  
Stage 2: For the second part, the healer should stand near the closest stone
right behind him. When he gives his cue to hide, everyone should run behind
that stone. Anyone in his line of sight will take damage.

  

"Begone, mortal!" or "Begone from my sight!" or "Run and hide if you can!"
Hide behind a stone.  
"Come over here!" or "To me!" Drugoth summons a whirlwind.  
Stage 3: In the final stretch, Drugoth will summon a spirit that stuns a
member and transfers the stunned member's abilities to him. Kill the spirit
quickly to clear the stun and skill transfer. For his other attacks, hide
behind a stone until he is finished.

  

Buffs encountered: Guardian's Revenge - Reflect 90% damage  

  

"Lend me your strength, X!" Spirit is summoned and class based skills are
transferred to Drugoth.  
"Those I see shall remain where they are." Hide behind a stone.  
"Freeze, quivering mortals!" Freezes the entire inner area with ice shards.
Hide behind a stone.  
Tier 2  
Challenge Mode: Kill all 4 Lieutenants during the Osan fight. This apparently
leads to the 2 Guardians needing to be killed in the final
