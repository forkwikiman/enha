노트 수가 무려 2821개로 국내 오투잼에서 가장 많은 곡이었다. [End Of Fight](End%20Of%20Fight.md) 등장
전까지 한동안 오투잼 [최고 난이도](%EC%B5%9C%EC%A2%85%EB%B3%B4%EC%8A%A4.md) 곡이었다.
[채보](%EC%B1%84%EB%B3%B4.md)는 욕 안 먹으면서 정정당당(?)하게 어렵고 노래도 좋다는 평을 듣는다.

Here we go  

Bring that beat back  

Microphone set yo microphone rec  
Code Red war like “AWACS” on the “revved up” cassette  
Cause I’m a soldier giving me the nerves like boulder  
Making a vocal call putting the lights out the storm  
Airwaves uproar like a cellular phone  
I hate snakes like Indiana Jones  
while “harakatan” did the tracks like storm  
mixing tracks like “tapper” rhymes busted thorugh your bones  
I get your Heart and I'd never wanna  
Feel you like “drama” or  
Gee cause my rhyme is the key  
Open up your mind and pass in the energy  
To me it is as easy as 1, 2, 3  
I make DO with the RE and MI  
Shine, on your mind, get busy one time  
Let the girls know that you're good to go  
I'll rock the show like I'll rock you whole  

Just this alley straight off the main “tow”  
because I “ricochet” it just get better  
and then i come out of the light because you know i'm legit  
i'm just in Hollywood let you know that'd be good  
just got the style let soak for some time  
and then i rock your microphone and make a “yaboodoowah”  
because i'm just rashee* i give you what you need  
wipping niggas up at the break next week  
I get your Heart and I'd never wanna  
Feel you like “drama” or  
Gee cause my rhyme is the key  
Open up your mind and pass in the energy  
To me it is as easy as 1, 2, 3  
I make DO with the RE and MI  
Shine, on your mind, get busy one time  
Let the girls know that you're good to go  
I'll rock the show like I'll rock you whole
