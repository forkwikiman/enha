## 1 개요 ¶

  

마이크로 소프트의 통합 개발 환경인 [비주얼 스튜디오](%EB%B9%84%EC%A3%BC%EC%96%BC%20%EC%8A%A4%ED%8A%9C%EB%94%94%EC%98%A4.md)에
[도전과제](%EB%8F%84%EC%A0%84%EA%B3%BC%EC%A0%9C.md)를 부여하는 확장기능이 발표되었다. 상용 버전이라면
무료로 설치가 가능하며(학생들은 드림스파크를 이용하자) 페이스북이나 블로그 등의 소셜 공유와 더불어 Leader Board 기능까지 지원하고
있다. 도전과제의 내용을 보면 주로 **좋은 프로그램을 만들기 위해서는 하지 말아야 할 일**들이 되어있다.
