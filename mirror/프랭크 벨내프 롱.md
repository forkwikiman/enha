대표적인 러브크래프티안 작가들중 한분으로, 대표적인 작품으로는 그 유명한 [틴달로스의 사냥개](%ED%8B%B4%EB%8B%AC%EB%A1%9C%EC%8A%A4%EC%9D%98%20%EC%82%AC%EB%83%A5%EA%B0%9C.md)와 우주를 먹는자(the space
eater)로, 작품자체로 볼때는 틴달로스의 사냥개는 오히려 미숙하고 우주를 먹는자가 더 뛰어나지만, 어쩐지 아는사람이 거의 없다(...)

  

[러브크래프트](%EB%9F%AC%EB%B8%8C%ED%81%AC%EB%9E%98%ED%94%84%ED%8A%B8.md)와 특별한
우정을 가지기도 했는데, 러브크래프트는 프랭크를 친구이자 멘토로 삼았다고한다.

A Man from Genoa (1926) (Athol, MA: W. Paul Cook)  

The Goblin Tower (Cassia FL: Dragon-Fly Press, 1935; New Collectors Group,

1945 edition, it is often mis-catalogued as a reprint of the 1935 Dragon-Fly
Press edition. In fact, the selection of poems differs; the New Collectors
Group edition drops four, "When Chaugner Wakes," "Exotic Quest," "West Indies"
and "Martial: The Vacationist" and adds three, "The Prophet," "Prediction" and
"Walt Whitman."
